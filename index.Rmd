Welcome to the Vector and Waterborne Pathogens Research Group NGS Analysis page.

This webpage was created me (Siobhon Egan) during an internship program at [Pawsey Supercomputing Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/) provided by [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/) in 2017/2018.

It takes you through analysis of bacterial 16S amplicon next-generation sequencing data - however it can be easily adapted to suit various other amplicon sequence data. 

As with anything coding and bioinformatics related this is just *one* method of data analysis.
The internet is wealth of information on programs, coding languages, plug ins and a number of different GUIs which you can use.

The aim of this webpage is to help by "taming the flood" of what can seem like a never ending world of NGS data analysis. 
I have endevroued to credit the resource and works of other people where appropriate - but if you feel your work has not been credited please send an email to siobhon.egan@murdoch.edu.au
