We hope this helps walk you through the analysis of your NGS data.

This is just *one* way to analyse your data, the internet is wealth of information on software programs, coding languages and a number of different GUIs which you can use.

We hope this helps by taming the flood of what can be a never ending world of NGS data analysis. We have endevroued to credit the resource and works of other people where we have used them - but if you feel we have not credited your work please send an email to siobhon.egan@murdoch.edu.au
